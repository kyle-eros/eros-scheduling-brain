## 🚀 **STAGE 1: GMAIL ETL PIPELINE**
*The Data Harvester*

### **What It Does:**
Automatically extracts OnlyFans mass message performance data from Infloww email reports every hour.

### **Detailed Process:**
1. **📨 Email Monitoring**: Scans kyle@erosops.com for new Infloww reports
2. **🔗 Link Extraction**: Finds download URLs buried in email tracking links
3. **📥 Smart Download**: Navigates through redirect chains to get actual Excel files
4. **✅ Validation**: Ensures files are valid Excel (not HTML error pages)
5. **🧹 Data Cleaning**:
   - Normalizes column names
   - Cleans currency fields ($24.00 → 24.00)
   - Standardizes timestamps
   - Preserves all time-series data (7 days per file)
6. **🔄 Smart Deduplication**: Checks BigQuery for existing (message_id + sending_time) combinations to avoid duplicates while preserving legitimate time-series data
7. **📤 Upload**: Loads clean data to `eros_source.mass_message_daily_final`
8. **☁️ Backup**: Stores raw Excel files in GCS for audit trails
9. **💾 State Tracking**: Remembers processed emails for incremental runs

### **Key Problems Solved:**
- ❌ **Manual Data Entry**: No more copying data from emails
- ❌ **Missing Reports**: Automated capture ensures no data loss
- ❌ **Infloww's 7-Day Limitation**: Handles rolling 7-day exports by only uploading new time periods
- ❌ **Time-Series Data Loss**: Preserves complete performance history across all time periods
- ❌ **Duplicate Processing**: Smart composite-key deduplication prevents data corruption
- ❌ **Format Inconsistencies**: Standardizes all data formats

---

The computations and factors involved in building the best 7-day templates for the EROS system include:

1. Optimal Send Times:

• Recommended Timing: BigQuery computes the optimal times for message sending based on historical performance data.

• Reason Codes: Each recommended time slot is accompanied by a reason code explaining why it was chosen (e.g., peak hour, high demand).

2. Fatigue Risk Management:

• Fatigue Scoring: A fatigue score (0-100) is calculated based on the volume of messages sent in the past 7 days and their performance impact.

• Risk Banding: Time slots are categorized into risk bands (e.g., safe, moderate, high risk) to prevent over-messaging.

3. AI-Generated Pricing:

• Dynamic Pricing: Calculations for recommended price points based on past revenue-per-message (RPM) and demand metrics.

• Price Optimization: Ensures the price correlates with expected engagement and conversions.

4. Data Enrichment:

• Caption Recommendations: AI ranks captions based on their historical performance (engagement, RPM, etc.) and suggests the best ones for the given time slots.

• Creator Heatmaps: Analyzes creator-specific engagement patterns to adjust timing dynamically.

5. Content and Action Planning:

• Action Types: Determines the type of message (e.g., PPV, Tip) to send during a specific time slot.

• Preview and Customization: Includes previews of captions and allows for last-minute changes or overrides by schedulers.

6. Real-Time Adjustments:

• Time Randomization: Adds a ±15-minute variance to scheduled times to avoid messaging patterns.

• Live Updates: Integrates real-time insights via the Google Sheets dashboard for dynamic scheduling decisions.

7. Data Validation:

• Deduplication: Ensures that no duplicate time slots or messages are planned.

• Consistency Checks: Enforces data validation rules, such as permissible actions and statuses.

8. Continuous Feedback Loop:

• Learning from Results: The system collects performance data from executed schedules and feeds it back to improve future recommendations.

• Manual Overrides: Allows schedulers to adjust plans, which are also analyzed for their impact.

These computations are implemented through BigQuery queries, Dataform pipelines, and the Google Sheets dashboard, ensuring the scheduling templates are data-driven, optimized, and actionable.
