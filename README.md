# 🆕 **NEW: TIER-BASED DAILY QUOTA SYSTEM**

## 🎯 **What It Does**
Automatically assigns each creator to performance tiers (A/B/C/D) and sets optimal daily message limits based on their subscriber base, engagement, and revenue potential.

### **🏆 The 8-Tier System**

| Tier | Page Type | Daily Quota | Target Revenue | Strategy |
|------|-----------|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **A_PAID** | Premium | 8-18 msgs | $200-500/day | Conversion Aggressive |
| **A_FREE** | Free | 6-15 msgs | $150-300/day | Conversion Intensive |
| **B_PAID** | Premium | 6-15 msgs | $100-250/day | Retention Quality |
| **B_FREE** | Free | 4-12 msgs | $75-200/day | Retention VIP |
| **C_PAID** | Premium | 4-12 msgs | $50-150/day | Growth Focused |
| **C_FREE** | Free | 3-10 msgs | $40-100/day | Engagement Builder |
| **D_PAID** | Premium | 2-8 msgs | $25-75/day | Careful Nurture |
| **D_FREE** | Free | 2-6 msgs | $20-50/day | Foundation Building |

### **🧠 How Tier Assignment Works**

**For PAID Pages** (subscription_price > $0):
```
Tier Score = (60% Revenue Rank) + (30% Subscriber Count) + (10% Retention Rate)
```

**For FREE Pages** (subscription_price = $0):
```
Tier Score = (50% Tip Revenue) + (30% Engagement) + (20% Conversion Rate)
```

### **📊 Weekly Performance Adjustments**
The system automatically adjusts daily quotas based on performance:

- **🚀 High Performers**: +1-2 additional message slots during peak hours
- **📈 Trending Up**: Extended premium pricing windows
- **⚠️ Underperforming**: Reduced quotas with focus on quality over quantity
- **🔄 Seasonal**: Automatic adjustments for holidays and special events

### **🎯 Business Benefits**

- ✅ **Performance-Based**: Higher tiers get more opportunities
- ✅ **Fatigue Prevention**: Built-in subscriber burnout protection
