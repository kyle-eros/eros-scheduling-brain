## 📖 How It Works - The Complete Story

### 🌊 The Data Journey (Step by Step)

```
Step 1: Infloww.com → Your Gmail
Step 2: Gmail → Python Script → BigQuery Database
Step 3: BigQuery → Dataform → Smart Tables
Step 4: Smart Tables → AI Analysis → Recommendations
Step 5: Recommendations → Dashboard → Your Team Uses It!
```

Let me explain each step in detail:

---

## 📚 Step-by-Step Breakdown

### 📧 **Step 1: Data Collection (Infloww → Gmail)**

**What Happens:**
- Every day, Infloww.com sends performance reports to your Gmail
- These emails contain stats about every mass message sent
- Data includes: usernames, prices, send times, open rates, click rates, revenue

**Why It Matters:**
- This is your raw gold - the foundation of all intelligence
- Without this data, we're flying blind

---

### 🔄 **Step 2: Data Extraction (Gmail → BigQuery)**

**What Happens:**
1. The `gmail-etl` folder contains a Python script
2. This script reads your Gmail inbox
3. It finds all Infloww emails automatically
4. Extracts the data from each email
5. Loads it into Google BigQuery (your data warehouse)

**The Magic:**
- **20,645 rows** of data processed from 493 emails
- **Deduplication** ensures no duplicate data
- **Automatic** - runs on schedule, no manual work

**How to Run It:**
```bash
# Navigate to the gmail-etl folder
cd gmail-etl

# Run the extraction
python main.py
```

---

### 🏗️ **Step 3: Data Transformation (Raw Data → Smart Tables)**

**What Happens:**
This is where Dataform comes in - it's like a factory that takes raw materials and builds useful products.

**The Factory Layers:**

#### **Layer 1: Source (Raw Materials)**
Tables that store raw data exactly as it comes from Gmail:
- `mass_message_daily_final` - Daily message performance
- `caption_bank_*` - Your content libraries (PPV, tips, renewals, bumps)
- `creator_statistics_final` - Creator performance metrics
- `scheduler_assignments_final` - Who's assigned to which creators

#### **Layer 2: Staging (Cleaning)**
Clean and standardize the messy raw data:
- `mass_messages` - Cleaned message data
- `captions` - Unified content catalog
- `messages_enriched` - Messages with extra calculated fields

#### **Layer 3: Features (Intelligence)**
Add smart calculations and AI analysis:
- `caption_theme_signals` - AI categorizes content into 35+ themes
- `fatigue_scores` - Calculates audience burnout risk
- `pricing_bands` - Groups content into price tiers

#### **Layer 4: Marts (Business Logic)**
Final tables with recommendations:
- `daily_recommendations` - Today's best opportunities
- `learning_insights` - What we've learned from history

#### **Layer 5: Service (User-Facing)**
What your team actually sees:
- `scheduler_dashboard` - The final dashboard view

---

### 🤖 **Step 4: AI Analysis (The Brain)**

**What the AI Does:**

#### **Content Categorization**
The AI reads every caption and automatically tags it:
- Soft Tease / Lingerie
- JOI / Instruction
- Roleplay scenarios
- Holiday/Seasonal content
- 30+ other categories

#### **Optimal Timing**
Analyzes when messages perform best:
- Peak engagement hours
- Best days of the week
- Timezone considerations

#### **Smart Pricing**
Learns what prices work:
- Compares similar content performance
- Suggests optimal price points
- Tracks price sensitivity

#### **Fatigue Management**
Protects your audience:
- 🔴 **RED** = High risk, audience is exhausted
- 🟡 **YELLOW** = Moderate risk, be careful
- 🟢 **GREEN** = Safe to send

---

### 📊 **Step 5: The Dashboard (What You See)**

**The Final Output:**
A clean dashboard showing:
- **Who** (scheduler name)
- **What** (creator username)
- **When** (optimal send time)
- **How Much** (suggested price)
- **Risk Level** (fatigue indicator)
- **Quality Score** (⭐⭐⭐ ranking)

**Sample Dashboard View:**
```
Scheduler: Sarah
Creator: jessica_love
Send Time: 7:00 PM EST
Suggested Price: $9.99
Fatigue Status: 🟢 SAFE
Quality: ⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT
```

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Add this to your query
WHERE loaded_date >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
```

#### **Issue 2: "GitHub token rejected"**
**Solution:**
1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer Settings → Personal Access Tokens
2. Generate new token with `repo` scope
3. Update in Google Secret Manager:
```bash
gcloud secrets versions add GITHUB_PAT_EROS --data-file=- <<< "your-token"
```

#### **Issue 3: "Column not found"**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Check table schema
bq show --format=prettyjson of-scheduler-proj:dataset.table
```

#### **Issue 4: "Dataform execution failed"**
**Solution:**
1. Check error message in Dataform UI
2. Look for the failing action
3. Review the SQL for that specific transformation
4. Common fixes:
   - Add partition filters
   - Fix column names
   - Resolve dependencies
